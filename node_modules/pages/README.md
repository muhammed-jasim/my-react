# pages #

An unofficial sidekick for AngularJS / (and optionally) Node.js applications. _It's a developer's framework for building applications, abstracting its dependencies, and reusing custom components more efficiently._

**Warning: This is betaware.**

## Why? ##

[Yeoman](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular) is great at what it does, but Pages _centralizes_ dependencies even further for AngularJS applications, and architects them _better_ for the large-scale (while still allowing application-specific customization). _Ideally_, this will become a Yeoman integration (now that it is at 1.0 RC1) :)

## Pre-reqs ##

Just make it so.

1. [OSX](http://apple.com)
1. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), version 0.10.12.
1. [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) For [Terminal Notifier](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier)
1. [Java](http://java-lang.org) For [node-minify](https://github.com/srod/node-minify)
1. [Terminal Notifier](https://github.com/alloy/terminal-notifier)
1. `curl`, `wget`, and `unzip`

## Install ##

```
sudo npm install -g pages
```

_Note:_ Pages doesn't require any dependency _but itself_ to be installed globally.

## Usage (simple) ##

**What can you do with Pages?**

```
pages help 
```

**Create a Pages application:**

```
pages generate --type=app --name="My Pages App"
cd my-pages-app
npm install # (only if you're using Node.js components)
```

This generates a non-compiled application from a default or configured skeleton.

_Note:_ The `name` option is sanitized to `my-pages-app`.

**Compile/watch/run a Pages application for `development`:**

```
cd my-pages-app
pages run --port=3000 --browser=chrome
```

This runs the Pages application compiler on port `3000`, watching for changes to CoffeeScripts, Jade templates, and dependencies; Google Chrome's first browser tab is automatically refreshed after bundling (compiling/downloading assets).

_Note:_  By default (not specifying the option), Pages runs applications on port `80`. If you do not have access to port `80`, it will hang.

**Compile/concat/minify/run a Pages application for `production`:**

```
cd my-pages-app
pages start --port=3000 --browser=chrome
```

_Note:_ The same default port assignments apply from the CLI command `pages run`, but a specified browser will refresh just _once_ after the build is done.


**Bake it for `production`, then run it with Foreman (Heroku):**

```
cd my-pages-app
npm install
pages bake --env=production
foreman start
```
